# Webpack Template

This is a customizable Webpack 5 template designed for efficient project setup and development. It includes configurations for both development and production environments, supporting modern JavaScript, CSS, and HTML workflows.

## Features

- **Development and Production Builds**: Separate configurations for development (`webpack.dev.js`) and production (`webpack.prod.js`) environments.
- **Asset Management**: Handles JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files with appropriate loaders and plugins.
- **Development Server**: Includes a development server with live reloading for a streamlined development experience.

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heavy-goose/webpack-template.git
